## 1. The tool (gencp-ref)

Extent → georeferenced 10 m synthetic reference GeoTIFF + ranked reliability sidecar +
embedded provenance. Deterministic by default (`--stochastic` preserves the evaluated path);
640 m feather overlap (seam clustering statistically zero: obs/exp 1.01, p = 0.46
[STOCH, POST]); corrected transform (TRUE_GSD 10.0390625) mandatory; `-s smart` extraction;
`--bands single` refuses pending the panchromatic conversion decision. Gate: render layer
byte-exact vs sound archive [DET-equivalent, POST]; mosaic interior exact; georef lag (0,0).
**HOLE: none — tool is delivery-shaped.**

## 2. Input/output contract

Input: bbox/GeoJSON + CRS + arm + bands. Output: reference.tif (10 m, requested CRS, tags:
tool version, arm, checkpoint sha256, seed, inference path, torch, OSM snapshots, CLC+
version, repo commit, seam ratio) + reliability.{tif,csv} + provenance sidecar + optional S2
QA preview (never an input). **HOLE: single-band output contract (B-package pending).**

## 3. The arms

| arm | config | status |
|---|---|---|
| pretrained | Zenodo release | baseline |
| C1 | GAN+L1 fine-tune, cold-start D, warm-up amendment | **B1 CLOSED: cold-D signature absent (C1 e1 already −0.40 vs pre at 6.3 SE); C1−C2 deficit widens with adversarial training (+0.55→+0.70) — loss-function effect confirmed (headline-results.md)** |
| C2 | L1-only fine-tune | recommended hand-over arm (Package A) |
| C3 | C2 + 17.7% EU mix | recommended training config; indistinguishable from C2 at n=30 |

## 4. The decomposed answer (all [STOCH] unless marked)

- Ankara 130, RGB KLT: pre 2.588 → C1 1.869 → C2 0.929 px; C2−pre −1.167 ± 0.074 [OVP]
  → **CBQ as headline: off production path.** Production restatement [POST, n=30]:
  C2−pre ≈ −0.84…−0.97 px.
- Europe 568: C2−pre −0.364 ± 0.024 [OVP-analogue corpus renders] — no forgetting.
- Cappadocia transfer R = 0.945, CI [0.73, 1.18] [PRE inputs] — adaptation, not scene
  memorisation.
- Restraint mechanism: blur control recovers −6.1%/+1.7% [OVP]; EU gain 86% scatter;
  matcher sweep: C2 margin grows under NCC (ank130 −0.70 → −1.01) [OVP] —
  **B3 CLOSED: ordering preserved under ORB (~4.5 SE), AKAZE, MI; mediation 0%; restraint measured directly (silent-region edge ratio: pre 1.02 / C1 1.02 / C2 0.22) — "matcher-independent" earned, quoted with its family boundaries (headline-results.md).**
- Urban operational headline: **0.593 px ± 0.041 (production path, K=8, n=20) [STOCH mean-of-8, POST]** — B2 verified the off-path 0.591 within +0.002; C2−pre −0.777 ± 0.125, 20/20 chips (headline-results.md).
- Salt/water rare class: unresolved (C2 salt gain statistically zero; water-dominant class
  absent from training).

## 5. Positioning

Reference-generation for their Georef (extent in → raster out), not GCP lists; two-arm
hand-over (C2 primary, C1 supplied) with the condition table from Package A.

**The positioning section is now [positioning-results.md](positioning-results.md), written for
verbatim lift.** Its three measurements (E1 availability, E2 currency, E3 operational
resolution) all came back negative for the product: no availability niche (0/24 extents lack a
cloud-free scene within 90 days; EOX covers 24/24), no currency niche (a five-year-old real
image still beats current-OSM synthetic, interaction null at <0.5 SE), and at 0.5 m targets
the resolution gap dominates the choice of source. **What the project delivers is a working
generator, a corrected georeferencing path, a reliability ranking that measurably helps, and a
measured account of where the premise does not hold.**

**Supporting detail, from the T1 benchmark ([T1-benchmark-results.md](T1-benchmark-results.md)):**
at a clean site, real 10 m imagery recovers known shifts far better than our synthetic
reference (real S2 / EOX / basemap 0.003–0.24 px vs GenCP C2 0.54–3.97 px at 1–5 px
displacement) [DET, POST]. **Where real 10 m imagery exists — including free Sentinel-2 and
free EOX cloudless — we recommend it over our own product.** The synthetic reference's niche
is (a) extents with no usable cloud-free acquisition and no acceptable mosaic, and (b) needing
the reference to reflect *current OSM content* rather than historical imagery. The tool's own
georeferencing is sound (intrinsic offset 0.157 px, better than real S2's 0.262 and EOX's
0.329); what it lacks is matchable content (388 KLT points vs 1164–1738).

**Reliability sidecar SHIPS AS A RECOMMENDATION** ([T3-reliability-results.md](T3-reliability-results.md)):
ranking under a budget improves the delivered median by 0.213 px (Ankara) and 0.424 px
(Cappadocia) at the 75% budget, on both sites, with the same features that failed as a fixed
threshold. Rank, do not threshold.

**Delivered artefact:** the ODTÜ package ([odtu-package-README.md](odtu-package-README.md)) —
reference GeoTIFF, reliability layer, provenance, recipient README, three-panel visual.

## 6. Honest record

15 corrections entries; 8 standing practices; every gate scored against pre-committed text;
FAILED gates on the record (veto rule; gate-1 FAILED-as-designed); registered predictions
that failed are quoted as failed (R2 scope, NCC prediction, attenuation story).

## 7. Limitations

**Real imagery outperforms the synthetic reference wherever it exists (T1)** — the project's
accuracy case is subordinate to its availability case; Georef unmeasurable (all numbers proxy;
Package A bounds proxy-sensitivity); **the ODTÜ extent is train-contaminated (14 chips), so
ODTÜ-measured accuracy is not representative**; train/serve
skew (training PRE, production POST; ~0.6 px forest-heavy cost, lands on the maskable
class — fortunate, not designed); Ankara evaluation inputs OVP (unregenerable — backed up,
manifest committed); scene-date confounds as registered; KLT noise floor ~2 px context.

## 8. Future work

Phase F backlog: veto re-registration; regenerable-label audit; retraining on POST inputs;
variance map (closed: sub-bar at converged K); sparse-EU regression under C3; single-band
package; B1 confirmatory run: NOT TRIGGERED (cold-D signature absent).
