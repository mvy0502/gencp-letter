# Geometry finding: the 257→256 scale error in GenCP HR outputs

**Status:** investigation only. No pipeline code was modified, no outputs were regenerated.
**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Verdict:** the 0.39 % scale error is **real, and exactly as predicted** — not larger, not smaller.
**Confirmed independently by KARIOS** ([`karios-validation.md`](karios-validation.md)): arm A shows
the predicted residual ramp at 9.9 sigma, removed by correcting the affine. But correcting it
improves total error by only 6 %, because matching noise dominates — see §12.4.
The HR training set has since been measured (§6): 257x257 is the project-wide convention, not a
demo artefact, which resolves the last material uncertainty and leaves the verdict unchanged.
The network's own input->output alignment is settled in §11: **equivariance** is certified
empirically to 0.008 px, and the **absolute** offset is shown analytically to be exactly zero.
These are two different claims and §11.6 states which argument supports which.
The train/inference scale mismatch first noted in §6.1 has outgrown this document and moved to
[`train-test-scale-mismatch.md`](train-test-scale-mismatch.md), which is now the **principal open
technical question** — larger in effect than the georeferencing arithmetic recorded here.

## 1. Observation

Input OSM rasters in `GenCP_HR_demo/data/dataset/test/` are 257×257 px at 10 m, i.e. 2570 m
on the ground. Model outputs are 256×256 px. `gencp_georeferencing.py` copies the input's
affine transform verbatim:

```python
with rasterio.open(reference_path) as src:
    with rasterio.open(out_image, "w", driver="GTiff",
                       height=test_img.shape[1],   # 256, from the generated array
                       width=test_img.shape[2],    # 256
                       crs=src.crs,
                       transform=src.transform):   # 10 m pixel size, from the 257-px source
```

The written raster therefore pairs a **256-px grid** with a transform whose pixel size is
**10.0 m**, declaring a footprint of 2560 m. If the 257×257 content was resampled to fill
256×256, the true ground sample distance is 2570/256 = 10.0390625 m and every GeoTIFF
carries a scale error that is zero at the origin and grows to one full pixel at the far corner.

This was flagged because it is the same order of magnitude as the accuracy budget KARIOS
is about to measure.

## 2. Method

Three independent lines of evidence were used, deliberately chosen so that no two share a
failure mode:

1. **Code path** — resolved dataloader options read from the run's own saved options file,
   plus the transform code actually executed.
2. **Hypothesis test** — reconstruct each candidate transform from the source raster and
   compare to the network's own recorded input, `_real.png`.
3. **Direct measurement** — subpixel phase correlation between `_real.png` and the source
   raster on a 4×4 grid of windows, which infers the geometry from the imagery alone and
   is independent of both the code reading and the resize hypotheses.

### Shift estimator and its validation

Translation was estimated by phase correlation with upsampled-DFT refinement
(Guizar-Sicairos et al., *Opt. Lett.* **33**, 156, 2008), implemented directly on NumPy so
the analysis needs no extra dependency. Windows were Hann-tapered and mean-subtracted.

The estimator was validated against known sub-pixel shifts before use. A first
implementation was **rejected**: it showed errors up to 1.14 px, comparable to the effect
being measured. The corrected implementation gives:

| true (dy, dx) | estimated (dy, dx) | error |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00, 0.00 | 0.000, 0.000 | 0.000 |
| 0.13, 0.13 | 0.070, 0.070 | −0.060 |
| 0.38, 0.38 | 0.270, 0.270 | −0.110 |
| 0.63, 0.63 | 0.710, 0.710 | +0.080 |
| 0.88, 0.88 | 0.920, 0.920 | +0.040 |
| 1.00, 0.00 | 0.990, 0.000 | −0.010 |
| −0.50, 0.75 | −0.460, 0.830 | +0.040 / +0.080 |
| 2.25, −1.40 | 2.110, −1.270 | −0.140 / +0.130 |

**Validated accuracy: RMS 0.076 px, max 0.14 px.** The estimator slightly under-reads small
shifts (a known windowing bias). This matters for interpretation and is handled in §4.3.

## 3. Measurements

### 3.1 Resolved dataloader options

From `GenCP_HR_demo/checkpoints/genCP_HR_RGB_model/test_opt.txt`, written by our own run:

| option | value in saved file | value actually in effect |
|---|---|---|
| `preprocess` | `resize_and_crop` | `resize_and_crop` |
| `load_size` | `256` | `256` |
| `crop_size` | `256` | `256` |
| `no_flip` | `False` | **`True`** |

> **The saved options file is misleading for three fields.** `test.py` writes the file during
> `parse()`, then overrides `no_flip → True`, `serial_batches → True` and `num_threads → 0`
> at lines 45–48, *before* `create_dataset(opt)` at line 50. The effective `no_flip` is
> therefore `True` — no random flip was applied. `preprocess`, `load_size` and `crop_size`
> are **not** overridden, so the saved values stand for those.

The executed path in `data/base_dataset.py::get_transform` is:

- `'resize' in preprocess` → `transforms.Resize([256, 256], BICUBIC)` — a **full-extent
  resample** of the 257×257 image onto a 256×256 grid.
- `'crop' in preprocess`, `params is None` → `transforms.RandomCrop(256)` applied to an image
  that is *already* 256×256 — **a no-op**, only one crop position exists.
- `not opt.no_flip` is `False` → no flip.

### 3.2 Hypothesis test (8 tiles)

Each candidate was reconstructed from the source `.tif` and compared to `_real.png`.
Mean over 8 tiles; per-tile figures were consistent to within ±0.3 MAD.

| hypothesis | mean MAD (DN) | max diff | mean corr |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H1 resize 257→256 (pipeline)** | **0.0574** | **1** | **0.999995** |
| H2 resize(load=256) + crop 256 | 0.0574 | 1 | 0.999995 |
| H2′ counterfactual, load=286 | 14.2272 | 244–255 | 0.810684 |
| H3 crop TL `[0:256, 0:256]` | 4.0486 | ~180 | 0.971214 |
| H3 crop TR `[0:256, 1:257]` | 3.9646 | ~190 | 0.972486 |
| H3 crop BL `[1:257, 0:256]` | 4.2364 | ~200 | 0.966857 |
| H3 crop BR `[1:257, 1:257]` | 4.2774 | ~200 | 0.967718 |

H1's residual is **max 1 DN** across every pixel of every tile — that is the
float→uint8 round-trip in `util.tensor2im`, not a geometric difference. The four H3 crops
are ~70× worse in MAD and reach ~200 DN maximum error.

**H2 is numerically identical to H1 here**, because `load_size == crop_size == 256` makes the
crop degenerate. H2 is not a distinct hypothesis under these options.

### 3.3 Direct measurement — 4×4 shift field

Representative tile `31TEJ_0704_00`. Windows are 64×64 px; "measured" compares the source
raster against `_real.png`; "control" compares the source raster against a *known* H1
resample produced locally. Sign convention: negative means `_real` content sits at smaller
row/column indices than the same content in the 257-px source.

| window | centre (y, x) px | measured dy | measured dx | control dy | control dx | conf |

| 3,3 | 223.5, 223.5 | −0.960 | −0.970 | −0.960 | −0.970 | 348 |

All 16/16 windows had sufficient texture (confidence ≫ 8); none were discarded.

Shift field figure: [`figures/geometric-shift-field.png`](figures/geometric-shift-field.png).
Measured magnitudes on the representative tile run from **0.86 m** (NW) to **13.65 m** (SE),
i.e. 0.086 → 1.365 output pixels.

### 3.4 Input geometry, independently confirmed (5 tiles)

| file | size | transform a, e | bounds W–E (m) | (bounds width)/(px count) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 31TEJ_0451_00 | 257×257 | +10.0, −10.0 | 603580 → 606150 = 2570 | 2570/257 = **10.0** |
| 31TEJ_0691_00 | 257×257 | +10.0, −10.0 | 606770 → 609340 = 2570 | 2570/257 = **10.0** |
| 31TEJ_0699_00 | 257×257 | +10.0, −10.0 | 605380 → 607950 = 2570 | 2570/257 = **10.0** |
| 31TEJ_0700_00 | 257×257 | +10.0, −10.0 | 600620 → 603190 = 2570 | 2570/257 = **10.0** |
| 31TEJ_0704_00 | 257×257 | +10.0, −10.0 | 607550 → 610120 = 2570 | 2570/257 = **10.0** |

All are `EPSG:32631`, north-up (b = d = 0), and internally self-consistent. **All 630** test
rasters are 257×257 at (10.0, 10.0) — uniform, not a subset of odd files.

---

## 4. Which hypothesis is confirmed

**H1 — full-extent resample — on three independent grounds.**

### 4.1 Code
`preprocess=resize_and_crop` with `load_size=256` executes `Resize([256,256], BICUBIC)` on
the 257×257 image. The subsequent `RandomCrop(256)` is a no-op on an already-256 image.

### 4.2 Reconstruction
H1 reproduces `_real.png` to a maximum of 1 DN (MAD 0.057, corr 0.999995). The best H3 crop
is off by MAD 4.05 and up to ~180 DN. H3 is excluded decisively.

### 4.3 Direct measurement
The shift field is a **linear ramp with its fixed point at the NW chip origin**, growing to
≈1 px at the SE corner — the H1 signature. It is not zero (excludes H3), not a uniform
offset (excludes a displaced crop), and shows no rotation or shear.

The strongest single piece of evidence is the **control column**: measuring the source
raster against a locally-produced, known-H1 resample yields the same slope as measuring it
against `_real.png`, agreeing to **≤ 5×10⁻⁶ px/px**. Whatever residual bias the estimator
has, it affects both equally, and `_real.png` is geometrically indistinguishable from a
known full-extent resample.

This also resolves the apparent discrepancy between the measured slope (−0.004162) and the
theoretical H1 slope (−0.003891, i.e. −(1 − 256/257)). The measurement is ~7 % steeper, but
the control — which *is* H1 by construction — reproduces exactly the same 7 %. The offset is
estimator bias (§2), not evidence against H1. The theoretical value stands.

### 4.4 H2 explicitly addressed
H2 cannot be "the answer rather than H1": with `load_size == crop_size == 256` the crop is
degenerate and H2 **is** H1. The order-of-magnitude-larger error would require
`load_size > crop_size`; with the pix2pix default `load_size=286` the error would be
286/256 = 1.1172, i.e. **11.72 %** rather than 0.39 %. That is not what this configuration does.

---

## 5. Quantified impact

Confirmed geometry: the 2570 m of input content is rendered onto 256 output pixels, but the
transform declares 10.0 m pixels.

- True GSD of output content: 2570/256 = **10.0390625 m**
- Declared GSD: 10.0 m
- **Scale error: +0.390625 % = exactly 1/256**
- The GeoTIFF declares a 2560 m footprint; the content spans 2570 m — **short by 10.0 m**

Ground displacement between where a feature actually sits and where the transform says it
sits, for one chip (error accumulates linearly from the NW origin):

| point | u, v (px) | dx (m) | dy (m) | radial (m) | radial (output px) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NW corner (origin) | 0, 0 | 0.000 | 0.000 | **0.000** | 0.000 |
| NE corner | 255, 0 | 9.961 | 0.000 | **9.961** | 0.996 |
| SW corner | 0, 255 | 0.000 | 9.961 | **9.961** | 0.996 |
| SE corner | 255, 255 | 9.961 | 9.961 | **14.087** | 1.409 |
| centre | 127.5, 127.5 | 4.980 | 4.980 | **7.043** | 0.704 |
| SE outer edge | 256, 256 | 10.000 | 10.000 | **14.142** | 1.414 |

The error is **systematic and fully deterministic**, not noise: it is the same ramp in every
chip, always anchored at the NW corner. Mean radial displacement over the chip area is
roughly 7 m; worst case 14.1 m.

## 6. Is 257 intentional? Answered by measuring the training set

`GenCP_HR_DB.zip` (1.71 GB, 2.55 GB unpacked, 11,416 rasters) was downloaded from Zenodo and
measured in full — not sampled.

| group | files | dimensions | pixel size | CRS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GenCP_HR_DB/train/` | 5,131 | **257x257 (100.0 %)** | (10.0, 10.0) | 5 UTM zones (EPSG:32630-32634) |
| `GenCP_HR_DB/test/` | 577 | **257x257 (100.0 %)** | (10.0, 10.0) | 5 UTM zones |
| `GenCP_HR_DB/image_pairs/train/` | 5,131 | **514x257 (100.0 %)** | (1.0, 1.0) | none |
| `GenCP_HR_DB/image_pairs/test/` | 577 | **514x257 (100.0 %)** | (1.0, 1.0) | none |

**257 is uniform, not mixed and not absent.** Every one of the 5,708 georeferenced rasters is
257x257 at exactly (10.0, 10.0) m. There are zero exceptions in the entire corpus.

**The paired A/B images share dimensions exactly.** `514 = 2 x 257`, and the check
`width == 2 * height` holds for all 5,708 pairs without exception. `AlignedDataset` splits at
`w/2`, giving A and B of 257x257 each.

**Which half is which** (measured, not assumed): the right half is byte-identical to the
same-named georeferenced raster in `train/` (corr 1.0000, MAD 0.00) and carries the signature of
a categorical rendering — its top 5 colours cover 54.3 % of pixels, comparable to the demo OSM
input's 71.7 %. The left half is continuous imagery: top 5 colours cover 1.2 %, with 51,960
distinct colours in 66,049 pixels. So the layout is **[satellite | OSM]**, and producing satellite
imagery from OSM with this corpus requires `--direction BtoA`. The `image_pairs` files carry no
CRS and a (1.0, 1.0) pixel size — they are plain images for pix2pix, with georeferencing held
separately in `train/` and `test/`.

**This overturns the previous revision's indirect inference.** That reasoning used the VHR demo's
256x256 chips to suggest 257 might be a rasterisation artefact of the HR demo dataset. It is not:
257x257 at 10 m is the convention across the whole HR corpus, training and test alike. The
verdict in §5 is unaffected — the scale error follows from 257-px content on a 256-px grid with a
10 m transform, regardless of why 257 was chosen.

### 6.1 Training-time geometry — a second, larger mismatch

Read from the executed code path, as for `test.py`:

- `options/base_options.py` defaults: `preprocess=resize_and_crop`, **`load_size=286`**, `crop_size=256`,
  `no_flip` is `store_true` so it defaults to **False** (flipping enabled).
- `options/train_options.py` overrides none of them.
- `train.py` overrides none of them (unlike `test.py`, which overrides `no_flip`, `serial_batches`
  and `num_threads` after the options file is written).
- Only `options/test_options.py` contains
  `parser.set_defaults(load_size=parser.get_default('crop_size'))`, commented
  *"To avoid cropping, the load_size should be the same as crop_size"*. **That override is why
  inference ran at load_size 256 and is absent at training time.**

So under released defaults, training applies to each 257x257 half: resize to 286x286, then a
random 256x256 crop at a position shared by A and B (`get_params` is computed once and passed to
both transforms), plus a shared random flip. A and B therefore stay mutually aligned — but the
scale differs from inference:

| stage | resize applied | GSD of content the model sees | ground extent of the 256-px grid |
|---|---|---|---|
| training | 257 -> 286, then random 256 crop | 10 x 257/286 = **8.986 m** | 2300.5 m |
| inference | 257 -> 256, no crop | 10 x 257/256 = **10.039 m** | 2570 m |

Ratio 286/256 = **1.1172**: at inference the network is shown content **11.7 % coarser** than
anything it saw during training. Note this is the same 286/256 factor as the "H2' counterfactual"
dismissed in §3.2 — dismissed correctly for *inference*, but it is what the code does at
*training*.

**Caveat, and it is a real one.** This describes the released code under its default options. The
authors' actual training command was not published: `GenCP_HR_Model_Weights.zip` contains only two
`latest_net_G.pth` files and no `train_opt.txt`, so the `load_size` actually used is not
recoverable from the released artefacts. If they passed `--load_size 256`, this mismatch does not
exist. **This is now the principal open question, and it is separate from the georeferencing
error, which stands either way.**

## 7. Upstream awareness

Searched the whole repository — `.py`, `.md`, `.txt`, and notebook **source cells** (an
initial grep matched base64 image data in notebook *outputs* and was discarded as a false
positive).

- No occurrence of `257` in any source file or notebook cell.
- No mention of `resample`, `rescale`, `scale factor`, `GSD`, or `ground sample`.
- `gencp_georeferencing.py` applies **no scale factor**. It takes `width`/`height` from the
  generated 256-px array and `transform` from the 257-px source, with nothing reconciling them.
- No comment or docstring anywhere acknowledges the size change.

**Conclusion: there is no evidence the upstream authors considered this.** The pairing of a
256-px grid with a 257-px source transform appears to be unexamined rather than a deliberate
approximation.

---

## 8. What remains uncertain

1. **Training-data geometry — RESOLVED.** Measured in §6: 257x257 uniformly, across the entire
   corpus. The model was trained on the same 257-px chips the demo uses, so the generated content
   does correspond to the full 2570 m extent and the problem is **metadata-only** — the pixels are
   right, the transform is wrong. This was previously the one uncertainty that could change the
   interpretation; it no longer can.
2. **The authors' actual training invocation — now the principal unknown.** Under released
   defaults, training resizes 257 -> 286 and random-crops 256, an 11.7 % scale difference from
   inference (§6.1). No `train_opt.txt` was released, so whether they overrode `load_size` cannot
   be determined from the published artefacts. This affects expected output *quality*, not the
   georeferencing arithmetic.
3. **Estimator bias.** Validated RMS 0.076 px; it under-reads small shifts. Affects the absolute
   slope by ~7 % but not the conclusion, because the control absorbs it identically (§4.3).
4. **Network input->output alignment is bounded, not resolved.** Measured in §11: no misalignment
   detected, but only to ~0.9 px (~9 m). That bound is the same order as the scale error itself,
   so this method cannot certify sub-pixel alignment at the precision KARIOS needs.
5. **Sub-pixel behaviour of BICUBIC resampling** on hard-edged categorical rasters may introduce
   edge-dependent bias not modelled here. It does not affect the scale factor, which is fixed by
   the 257->256 grid ratio, not by the kernel.
6. **Whether 10.0390625 m or 10.0 m is the "intended" GSD** is a project decision, not a
   measurement. §5 quantifies the discrepancy; it does not adjudicate which is correct.
7. **KARIOS interaction.** KARIOS may itself fit and report a scale/shift term. Whether this ramp
   should be subtracted beforehand or left in and interpreted is a validation-design choice.

## 9. Options (proposals only — nothing implemented)

### Option A — correct the affine at georeferencing time
Write the transform with a 10.0390625 m pixel size, keeping the same NW origin.

- **Changes:** outputs become geometrically correct; the 10 m footprint discrepancy disappears.
  Cheap — only metadata; the existing 50 outputs can be rewritten without re-running inference.
- **Risks:** outputs carry a non-round GSD, which some downstream tools and mosaicking steps
  dislike; the GenCP_DB then differs from anything produced by the stock upstream script, so
  results are no longer bit-comparable with the published demo.
- **Upstream code:** touched **only if** `gencp_georeferencing.py` is edited. It can be avoided
  entirely by writing a separate script under `tubitak/`.

### Option B — resample outputs back onto the 257 grid
Resample each 256×256 output to 257×257 and keep the original 10.0 m transform.

- **Changes:** outputs align exactly with the input grid and keep a round 10 m GSD.
- **Risks:** introduces a **second interpolation** over generated imagery. This softens texture
  and alters pixel statistics — directly harmful to the radiometric and texture metrics KARIOS
  and FID-style scores are meant to measure. Strongly disfavoured for an accuracy study.
- **Upstream code:** none, if done in a new script.

### Option C — leave the data alone, model the bias in validation
Keep the GeoTIFFs as they are; subtract a known 0.390625 % scale ramp (anchored at the NW
corner) when interpreting KARIOS results.

- **Changes:** nothing on disk. The bias becomes a documented, exactly-known quantity rather
  than an unexplained residual.
- **Risks:** every downstream consumer must know; easy to forget later or for another team
  member. If KARIOS reports a scale term, it must be recognised as expected rather than an error.
- **Upstream code:** none.

### Option D — remove the resample at source
Run inference with `--preprocess none` (or a crop) so the model sees a 256 window of the
257 raster with no rescaling.

- **Changes:** eliminates the error at its origin rather than patching metadata.
- **Risks:** **changes what the model sees**, and therefore the generated imagery — all outputs
  must be regenerated, and results diverge from the published demo. If the model was trained on
  resampled 257→256 chips, this introduces a train/test mismatch that could *degrade* output
  quality. Should not be considered until §8.1 is resolved.
- **Upstream code:** no edit needed (CLI options only), but results change.

### Option E — report upstream
Open an issue on `telespazio-tim/GenCP` describing the 257/256 transform mismatch.

- **Changes:** nothing locally.
- **Risks:** none; independent of whichever of A–D is chosen.
- **Upstream code:** none.

**No option has been implemented. This is a decision for the project owner.**

## 10. Reproducing these measurements

The analysis code is committed under `tubitak/scripts/` — the measurements below regenerate from
a clean checkout. The estimator is also intended for reuse during KARIOS validation.

| script | purpose |
|---|---|
| `shift_estimator.py` | phase-correlation (same-modality) and NCC (cross-modal) estimators, plus the validation harness of §2 as a runnable self-test |
| `hypothesis_test.py` | the H1/H2/H2'/H3 reconstruction comparison of §3.2 |
| `shift_field.py` | the 4x4 shift-field measurement of §3.3 and the quiver figure; takes an arbitrary raster pair as arguments |
| `network_alignment.py` | the input->output alignment measurement of §11, with its own cross-modal validation |

```bash
conda activate gencp

# validate the estimator before trusting anything it produces
python tubitak/scripts/shift_estimator.py --self-test

# section 3.2

The training set (§6) is not committed: `GenCP_HR_DB.zip` is 1.71 GB and lives in
`tubitak/data/`, which is gitignored. Re-download from
<https://zenodo.org/records/15044428>.

No pipeline file was modified and no output was regenerated at any point in this investigation.

## 11. Does the network preserve spatial alignment?

### 11.1 Why this needed measuring

The GeoTIFFs contain `_fake`, the network's **output**, while every measurement in §3 compares
`_real.png`, the network's **input**. The bridge — *"a U-Net preserves pixel alignment"* — is true
by architecture but was an untested assumption underneath every number here. Any misalignment
would add to the KARIOS budget and be confounded with the scale ramp of §5.

### 11.2 Two methods that did not work, with their numbers

**Attempt 1 — cross-modal (OSM input vs generated output).** Different modalities, so raw
intensity is uncorrelated and a gradient proxy is required. Phase correlation fails outright:

| estimator | representation | window | RMS error | max error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| phase correlation | gradient | 256 / 128 / 64 | 2.506 / 9.050 / 14.772 | 8.54 / 37.98 / 64.04 |
| phase correlation | intensity | 256 / 128 / 64 | 8.912 / 5.432 / 9.222 | 40.82 / 29.26 / 62.52 |

Errors of 40-64 px on a 256-px chip mean the peak is random: whitening destroys robustness when
the images share no intensity structure. Bounded-search NCC on gradients recovered usable pooled
statistics (validated limit 0.87 px) and gave a pooled median offset of 0.28 px over 84 windows —
no misalignment detected, but **bounded only to ~0.9 px (~9 m)**, the same order as the scale error
itself and therefore too loose to certify anything.

**Attempt 2 — against real satellite ground truth.** The training pairs are `[satellite | OSM]`,
so the OSM half can be pushed through the network and the output compared with the *real*
satellite half. Same modality — but this was **worse**, not better:

| | value |
|---|---|
| estimator resolution limit (validated, NCC + sigma=4 smoothing, full chip) | 0.307 px |
| per-chip offsets, spread | std 3.4 px, range approx. -2.6 to +8.0 px |
| pooled median offset | dy +0.458 +/- 0.682 px, dx +0.602 +/- 0.660 px |
| resulting bound | **1.92 px (19 m)** |

The reason is instructive: the generator produces a *plausible* scene, not the real one. Its fine
texture is hallucinated and uncorrelated with reality, so correlating output against truth finds a
best-match offset dominated by content mismatch rather than geometry. Ground truth does not help
when the thing being measured does not reproduce it pixel for pixel.

### 11.3 The method that worked: translation equivariance

Remove ground truth from the question. Two 256x256 crops are taken from the same up-sampled OSM
canvas, offset by a known integer translation of 16 px — no resampling difference between them, no
wraparound. Both are pushed through the network. If the network preserves alignment, the outputs
must agree over their 240x240 overlap once that known offset is undone. The two images being
compared are then **the same modality with the same content**, precisely the regime where phase
correlation is accurate. Any residual is attributable to the network alone.

Validated on this very data: **RMS 0.0505 px, p90 0.090 px, max 0.100 px** — sub-0.1 px capable.

### 11.4 Result (34 chips, 26 MGRS tiles)

| statistic | dy (px) | dx (px) |
|---|---|---|
| median | 0.00000 | 0.00000 |
| mean | +0.00121 | +0.00364 |
| std | 0.00781 | 0.01245 |
| standard error | 0.00136 | 0.00217 |
| max abs residual | 0.020 | 0.050 |

**One chip of 34 was rejected and is reported, not hidden:** `30TXQ_0830_00` returned exactly
(+15.99, +16.01) px — the crop offset itself, meaning the correlation locked onto the *uncorrected*
alignment. That is a periodic-structure ambiguity in the estimator, not a network shift. The
rejection rule (|residual| >= 1 px) is applied in code and its count printed on every run.

**95 % bound on any systematic shift (|mean| + 2 x SE): 0.00797 px = 0.0797 m = 8 cm.**

### 11.5 Equivariance is not absolute alignment

The equivariance test certifies that translating the input translates the output identically. It
**cannot detect a constant offset**: if the network displaced every output by a fixed amount,
`output(shift(X)) == shift(output(X))` would still hold exactly. A constant half-pixel offset from
mismatched conv/deconv geometry is a known failure mode, so it was settled separately — and
analytically, since the empirical probe turned out to be unusable (§11.5.2).

#### 11.5.1 The arithmetic

Every downsample in `UnetSkipConnectionBlock` is `nn.Conv2d(kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1)`
and every upsample is `nn.ConvTranspose2d(kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1)` with
`output_padding` left at its default of **0**. There are no exceptions across the eight levels.
(The `output_padding=1` visible at `models/networks.py:362` belongs to `ResnetGenerator`, which
`unet_256` does not use.)

A strided convolution samples on a grid aligned with its input — no half-pixel shift — exactly when

    p == (k - s) / 2

Here (4 − 2)/2 = 1 = p, an integer, so the condition holds exactly. The classic failure mode
`k=3, s=2, p=1` gives (3−2)/2 = 0.5, which is not an integer: no padding can centre it, and a
half-pixel offset is unavoidable. This architecture is not in that family.

Propagating receptive-field centres, with
`start_out = start_in + ((k-1)/2 - p) * jump_in` and `jump_out = jump_in * s`:

| level | size | jump | centre of pixel 0, in input coordinates |
|---|---|---|---|
| input | 256 | 1 | 0.0 |
| down 1 | 128 | 2 | 0.5 |
| down 2 | 64 | 4 | 1.5 |
| down 3 | 32 | 8 | 3.5 |
| down 4 | 16 | 16 | 7.5 |
| down 5 | 8 | 32 | 15.5 |
| down 6 | 4 | 64 | 31.5 |
| down 7 | 2 | 128 | 63.5 |
| down 8 | 1 | 256 | **127.5** |

The 1x1 bottleneck lands at input coordinate **127.5**, which is exactly the geometric centre of a
256x256 image (pixel centres 0..255). The encoder is centred at every level and accumulates no
drift.

For the decoder, `ConvTranspose2d(k=4, s=2, p=1)` is the exact adjoint of `Conv2d` with the same
parameters. Its output size is `(N-1)*s - 2p + k = 2N` exactly with `output_padding=0`, so the
upsampled grid coincides cell-for-cell with the grid the matching convolution consumed: coarse
pixel c spreads to fine pixels [2c−1 .. 2c+2] with centre 2c+0.5, the exact inverse of the
encoder's map. Each down/up pair is therefore an exact geometric inverse, and the composition over
eight levels is the identity on pixel indices.

**Conclusion: the absolute offset is exactly 0.000 px, by construction of the sampling geometry and
independent of what the weights learned.**

#### 11.5.2 The empirical probe, and why it is inconclusive

An attempt was made to confirm this by differentiating an output pixel with respect to the input
and locating the peak of the sensitivity map (the receptive-field centre of the trained network).
Over 72 interior probes it gave a mean offset of dy +0.300 ± 0.048, dx +0.070 ± 0.038 px — the dy
figure being 6 standard errors from zero, apparently contradicting the analytic result.

A control settled it. Running the identical probe on **random weights**, where the architecture and
therefore any geometric offset are unchanged, gave dy −0.472, dx −0.509 px. The two readings
disagree by 0.77 px on identical geometry, so the probe is measuring the *weights*, not the
sampling grid: a trained kernel can bias the centre of mass of its response within its 4x4
footprint without moving the sampling grid at all.

**The Jacobian probe is therefore weight-dependent and inconclusive below ~1 px.** It excludes a
constant offset larger than about 1 px and nothing finer. Reported here rather than dropped,
because on its own it would have looked like evidence of a +0.3 px offset.

(The first version of this probe used the *centroid* of the whole sensitivity map, which is worse
still: with a 1x1 bottleneck every output pixel depends on the entire input, so the centroid simply
drifts toward the image centre — an output pixel at (64,64) gave a centroid at (104.6, 93.1).)

### 11.6 Verdict (corrected)

Two distinct claims, established by two different arguments:

| claim | value | established by | strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| **equivariance** — a shift in equals the same shift out | **0.008 px (8 cm)** | measurement, 33 chips (§11.4) | empirical, tight |
| **absolute offset** — output pixel (i,j) depicts input pixel (i,j) | **exactly 0** | conv/deconv arithmetic (§11.5.1) | analytic, exact |

The empirical bounds on the *absolute* offset are much looser than the analytic result: ~0.9 px
from the cross-modal measurement (§11.2) and ~1 px from the Jacobian probe (§11.5.2). Neither
contradicts zero; neither is tight enough to certify it. **The analytic argument is what certifies
absolute alignment**, and it is exact rather than statistical.

For KARIOS this means the generator contributes **nothing measurable** to the *geometric* error
budget. The 0-14.1 m scale ramp of §5 is the whole of the geometric error, and it is fully
deterministic. This says nothing about whether generated chips *match* well — that is a separate
question, addressed in [`hallucinated-structure.md`](hallucinated-structure.md).

Note the contrast with §11.2: the two "obvious" measurements — compare to the input, compare to
truth — both failed, one at 0.9 px and one at 1.9 px, because both compared images whose content
differs. Removing ground truth from the question improved the bound by more than two orders of
magnitude.

## 12. Dataset observations

Defects in the published data rather than in the code, collected here so an upstream issue can be
written from one place. Neither affects the geometry findings above; both affect how results
should be interpreted.

### 12.1 The published train/test splits overlap

**9 of the 577 chips in `GenCP_HR_DB/image_pairs/test/` also appear in
`GenCP_HR_DB/image_pairs/train/`** (1.6 %). The published test split is therefore not strictly
held out.

```
30UYC_0352_00   31TGH_0086_00   31TGH_0216_00   31TGH_0226_00
30UYC_1132_00   31TGH_0207_00   31TGH_0220_00   31TGH_0240_00
31TGH_0082_00
```

Concentrated in two MGRS tiles (30UYC, 31TGH), which suggests a tiling or de-duplication slip
rather than random contamination. All 9 were excluded from every measurement in this work.

### 12.2 The demo dataset partially overlaps the training corpus

**25 of the 630 chips in `GenCP_HR_demo/data/dataset/test/` appear in the training corpus** (4 %) —
24 in `train`, 1 in the DB `test` split.

```
31TFH_0030_00  31TFJ_1114_00  31TFJ_1361_00  31TFJ_1413_00  31TFJ_1428_00
31TFH_0031_00  31TFJ_1346_00* 31TFJ_1363_00  31TFJ_1415_00  31TFJ_1433_00
31TFJ_0389_00  31TFJ_1352_00  31TFJ_1368_00  31TFJ_1416_00  31TFJ_1435_00
31TFJ_0410_00  31TFJ_1353_00  31TFJ_1372_00  31TFJ_1418_00  31TFJ_1446_00
31TFJ_1356_00  31TFJ_1408_00  31TFJ_1423_00  31TFK_1475_00  31TFK_1484_00
                                                    (* in the DB test split)
```

The demo folder is presented as a test set, so anyone processing all 630 chips is silently mixing
seen and unseen data. **This does not affect the results in this repository:** the 50 chips
actually processed are all `31TEJ`, and no `31TEJ` chip appears anywhere in the corpus — those
results are fully held out.

### 12.3 Suggested wording for an upstream issue

Three items, in descending order of consequence:

1. **`gencp_georeferencing.py` writes a 256-px raster with a 257-px source transform**, giving a
   +0.39 % scale error, 0 m at the NW corner and 14.1 m at the SE corner (§1-§5). The published
   KARIOS figures are consistent with this being a large part of the reported mean error — see
   §12.4.
2. **Training and inference use different `load_size`** (286 vs 256), an 11.7 % scale difference,
   with no `train_opt.txt` released to confirm what was actually used
   ([`train-test-scale-mismatch.md`](train-test-scale-mismatch.md)).
3. **The dataset defects in §12.1 and §12.2.**

### 12.4 The published KARIOS figures — plausible, not demonstrated

The upstream README reports KARIOS results on a held-out site: *mean error around 0.7 pixel (7 m)
and RMSE around 2.5 pixels (24 m) due to outliers, mostly in rural areas.*

The mean radial displacement predicted by the scale error of §5, averaged over the chip area, is

    0.0390625 m/px x mean(sqrt(u^2+v^2)) over [0,256]^2  =  0.0390625 x 195.9  =  7.65 m

**7.65 m predicted versus ~7 m reported.** That looked close enough to be worth stating.

> **UPDATE 2 — the earlier retraction was itself based on an invalid comparison, and is withdrawn.**
> KARIOS's `mean_x`/`mean_y` are the signed means of per-point displacements, i.e. the GLOBAL
> SYSTEMATIC SHIFT, not a per-point error magnitude (source quoted in
> [`karios-validation.md`](karios-validation.md) §8.1). The first update compared our per-point mean
> radial against upstream's global shift — different quantities — and over a point set 23x larger,
> because KARIOS's own summary applies a 0.8 confidence threshold that keeps only ~4 % of points.
>
> On the statistic upstream actually reports we are **better, not worse**: global shift 0.155 px
> versus their 0.70 px, per-axis RMSE 1.03/0.91 px versus their 2.50 px. Correcting the affine
> reduces the global shift by **40.3 %**, not 6.1 %.
>
> **Current status: plausible, not demonstrated.** For it — the ramp predicts a 0.707 px mean radial
> displacement, matching their 0.70 px almost exactly. Against it — our own arm A global shift is
> only 0.2595 px, so we do not directly measure a 0.7 px bias. Offer it upstream as a hypothesis
> with the arithmetic, not as an established finding.

The reported RMSE tail — *"outliers, mostly in rural areas"* — is a separate effect, and it is
**confirmed by the KARIOS run**: residual magnitude correlates with OSM edge density at
rho = −0.794 (n = 116). See [`hallucinated-structure.md`](hallucinated-structure.md) and
[`karios-validation.md`](karios-validation.md) §4.4.
