# gencp-ref tool package — results, scored against the registrations

> **Conventions (project-wide, 2026-08-21):** every paired difference is **Δ = candidate − baseline; negative = candidate better**. Where "gain" appears it is defined at point of use as −Δ. **Inference path:** registrations B and C were measured on the **stochastic (dropout-active) path**; registration A is the deterministic-vs-stochastic comparison itself; the delivered tool now **defaults to the deterministic path** (decision 2026-08-21), with the stochastic path behind `--stochastic`.

**Date:** 2026-08-21, branch `tubitak-tool`. Registrations:
[tool-gate-registration-2.md](tool-gate-registration-2.md) (commit `c4f8804`) and
[tool-registrations-3.md](tool-registrations-3.md) (commit `b80f384`) — all committed before
their numbers existed. The first gate registration stands as FAILED-as-designed
([tool-gate-registration.md](tool-gate-registration.md)); its failure produced corrections-log
entries 13–15 and the invariance rule in [standing-practices.md](standing-practices.md).

## Correctness gate (re-registered) — criteria 2 & 3 PASS; criterion 1 byte-exact where the archive is sound

- **Criterion 1 (tile space):** the full production path (country snapshot → `-s smart`
  extent extract → CLC+ render → bicubic 256) reproduces the verified corpus inputs
  **byte-exactly** on 30TXQ_0830_00 and 30TXQ_0934_00. The third chip (30TXQ_0879_00)
  failed because its archived input is itself a stale pre-fix render (entry 15's census
  later put the corpora at two-thirds stale). The fake layer of this criterion is
  unsatisfiable across processes (test-time dropout, entry 14) and was recorded as such,
  not scored.
- **Criterion 2 (mosaic space): PASS** — interior pixels equal the independent
  corrected-affine warp exactly; all ±1 differences lie inside the registered blend zone.
- **Criterion 3 (georeferencing): PASS** — transform exact, embedded GSD 10.0390625,
  cross-correlation lag (0,0) against the verified evaluation warps, all chips.

## Seam experiment — blending adequate; 640 m default

| overlap m | seam ratio | points obs/exp near seams (p) | duplicated generation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (baseline, not quotable as a result) | 1.234 | 1.12 (0.12) | — |
| 160 | 0.958 | 1.12 (0.029) | 12% |
| 320 | 0.970 | 1.17 (0.003) | 23% |
| **640 (default)** | **1.008** | **1.01 (0.46)** | 44% |
| 960 | 0.996 | 1.00 (0.52) | 61% |

No blended configuration triggers the registered inadequacy criteria (ratio > 1.10;
clustering obs/exp > 1.25 at p < 0.05), but seam attraction is *statistically detectable* at
160/320 m and vanishes at 640 m. Default 640 m: we take the safe side of our own threshold
and pay 44% duplicate generation — the same reasoning that discarded the warm-up run. 160 m
is the documented economy setting.

## Registration A — determinism: dropout-off is score-indistinguishable

Paired (deterministic − seeded), 30 production-input chips, all four arms: pretrained
−0.004 ± 0.089, C1 −0.040 ± 0.077, C2 −0.021 ± 0.092, C3 −0.028 ± 0.070 px — **all in the
registered ≤ 0.05 px "indistinguishable" band**, with the no-op guard confirming the images
genuinely differ (70–90% of pixels). **Precision limit, stated:** with n = 30 and
SE ≈ 0.077 px this rules out shifts larger than roughly 0.15 px, NOT all shifts —
"indistinguishable" has a resolution and this is it. **Decision (2026-08-21):
`--deterministic` is now the DEFAULT** — a delivered tool must hold "same input → same
output" unconditionally; seed-pinned reproducibility holds only per library build and
machine, dropout-off holds everywhere; disabling dropout at inference is the standard
convention, the stochastic path was the unusual one. The evaluated stochastic path stays
available via `--stochastic`; provenance records which path produced every file.

## Registration B — acceptance gate re-run: PASS on the registered estimator, and the original figure is retired

Same claim, same 0.15 px bound, corrected input path, mean-of-8 estimator (small-n standing
rule), 25 held-out chips, harness replicated from the original (verified: 17/25 regenerated
inputs differ from the stale corpus — exactly entry 15's census count).

| estimator | paired Δ (ours − corpus refs) | verdict at 0.15 px |
|---|---|---|
| **mean-of-8 (registered)** | **+0.119 ± 0.138 px** (t = 0.86) | **PASS** |
| single draw (seed 42) | +0.1495 ± 0.143 px | PASS by 0.0005 px |
| original (stale corpus, single draw) | +0.012 ± 0.132 px | retired — not quotable |

**Quotable sentence, in this order:** *held-out acceptance **+0.119 ± 0.138 px, PASS
(bound 0.15)*** — the bound was set against the aggregate, so the aggregate leads — *and the
decomposition follows:* the shift is carried almost entirely by the five German-zone chips
(+0.61 px mean) while the 20 non-German chips sit at −0.004 px. **The German split is a
pre-planned stratification, not a post-hoc observation:** the snapshot-drift caveat with its
"reported per-chip" instruction was committed in the registration (`b80f384`,
2026-08-20 20:49) hours before the numbers existed (2026-08-21 00:09). The drift attribution
(the 14:42 `germany-latest` re-download; content drift, not render path) remains the
registration's, not established by this run. **The single-draw analogue passes by
0.0005 px** — reported prominently, because it is the best available evidence that the
registered mean-of-8 estimator was the right choice: the small-n standing rule moved the
estimate off the bound's edge, it did not manufacture the PASS. The retired +0.012 flags now
point here.

## Registration C — K-draw averaging: marginal; variance map real but sub-bar

- **Mean-of-8 vs single draw** (Δ = mean-of-8 − single; negative = averaging better): ≈ 0
  on all Overpass-input cells (−0.014…−0.002 px) and EU C1 (+0.001); EU C2 −0.046 ± 0.031;
  **production-input C2 −0.131 ± 0.078** (n = 30, ~1.7 SE) — the only cell crossing the
  registered worth-it line (registered as "improvement ≥ 0.10 px", i.e. Δ ≤ −0.10), weakly
  supported, and on the production-relevant configuration.
- **Variance map:** the registered usability bar (rho ≥ +0.15, p < 0.01, both arms at one
  site) is **not met**; the signal is nonetheless replicated and highly significant
  everywhere it matters: production-Ankara C1 +0.122 / C2 +0.142, EU C1 +0.118 /
  C2 +0.112 (all p < 1e-7). Per the registration it is not adopted; recorded as a
  sub-threshold, replicated signal — follow-up candidates: higher K, different local
  window. The reliability sidecar therefore **stays input-heuristic for now**.
- Cost realism: 6,240 inferences + 1,560 KARIOS runs in 20.6 min wall at 64-wide
  parallelism — K = 8 is far cheaper than budgeted.
- Pattern worth stating: averaging helps, and variance predicts residual, **precisely where
  inputs are production-provenance** — consistent with model uncertainty concentrating on
  the (forest-bearing) content the train/serve skew under-represents.
- All numbers here are KLT-conditional, as registered: the institution's matcher is not
  KLT, and no gain is assumed to transfer.

## Registration D — variance map at K = 32: the attenuation story is refuted; K = 8 was already converged

Registered instrument fix, same +0.15 bar ([tool-registration-4.md](tool-registration-4.md),
commit `18ea887`). 18,720 new draws (24 seeds per cell on top of regC's 8), 780 mean/std-of-32
compositions, 780 KARIOS runs, zero failures, checkpointed throughout (standing practice 7).

| cell | rho K=8 | rho K=32 | rose? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ankara-Overpass / pretrained | +0.150 | +0.149 | no |
| Ankara-Overpass / C1 | +0.034 | +0.034 | ±0 |
| Ankara-Overpass / C2 | +0.006 | −0.000 | no |
| Ankara-production / pretrained | +0.003 | −0.035 | no |
| Ankara-production / C1 | +0.122 | +0.110 | no |
| Ankara-production / C2 | +0.142 | +0.139 | no |
| EU / C1 | +0.118 | +0.118 | ±0 |
| EU / C2 | +0.112 | +0.106 | no |

**Bar verdict: FAIL at all three sites** (best fine-tuned cell +0.139 < +0.15). **Attenuation
verdict: the registered prediction — rho must rise with K if estimator noise explained the
sub-bar result — is REFUTED.** Quadrupling the draws left every rho essentially unchanged:
the K = 8 estimates were already converged, and the variance-map effect **really is sub-bar**
— the registration's "more informative outcome," reported plainly. The adoption clause is not
triggered; **the reliability sidecar stays input-heuristic, now on converged evidence rather
than a possibly-noisy instrument.** Secondary read-out (Δ = mean-of-32 − single, negative =
averaging better): no cell beyond ~2 SE (best: production-C2 −0.123 ± 0.066); averaging buys
no material geolocation gain, consistent with K = 8. The mechanism sentence stands on the
record regardless: model uncertainty is real, replicated (p < 1e-6 in five cells), predicts
per-point residual weakly but consistently, and concentrates where inputs are
production-provenance — the skew, forest, and model uncertainty resolve into one story; the
map is simply not strong enough at the registered bar to replace the input heuristics.

## Standing state

Production tool: **deterministic by default** (dropout off; `--stochastic` preserves the
evaluated path), seeded, 640 m overlap, corrected transform mandatory, provenance embeds
inference path/seed/torch/snapshot/checkpoint-hash/commit. `--bands single` still refuses
pending Package A — which has no artifacts in this repository *[true when written; `evidence/pkgA/` committed 26 Aug — absence-claims audit 2026-09-13, TR]* and is scored elsewhere; the
branch stays isolated from `tubitak-tr` until that score exists.
